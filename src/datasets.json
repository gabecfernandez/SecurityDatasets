  "description": "A goal of this project is to characterize internal enterprise traffic recorded at a medium-sized site, and to determine ways in which modern enterprise traffic is similar to wide-area Internet traffic, and ways in which it is quite different.\n\nWe have collected packet traces that span more than 100 hours of activity from a total of several thousand internal hosts. This wealth of data, which we are publicly releasing in anonymized form, spans a wide range of dimensions.",
